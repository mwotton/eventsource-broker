EventSource Broker
=================

A simple bridge between EventSource and an AMQP fanout exchange.

EventSource is a new browser standard released as part of the HTML5
spec.

It lets the browser send a never-ending HTTP request to a server and
provides a javascript API for binding to events pushed from the server.

EventSource is very handy when you don't need the full bidirectional
communication that Websockets offers. it plays well with load-balancers,
intermediary proxies and HTTPS termination.

This library sets up an EventSource that clients can connect to
specifying a channel to listen to in the query string. The server
connects to a fanout AMQP exchange and routes AMQP messages as events to
the javascript clients.

The server expects the AMQP messages to be JSON following the format:

    {
        "channel": "some-channel", // Required
        "data": "{/"msg/": /"data/"}", // Required
        "id": "event-id", // optional
        "name": "event-name" // optional
    }

Installation
============

Clone the repository, cd to the root of it and execute

    cabal install

Run as:

    eventsource-broker -p <port>

The broker will look for an AMQP_URL environment variable for a broker
to connect to.

The repository includes a small ruby script to send data to channels and
the server will by default serve up a simple index page subscribing to
the channel "test".
